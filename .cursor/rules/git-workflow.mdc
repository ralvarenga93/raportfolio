# Git Workflow Rules

## Git Commands
- Provide an explanation of what each git command that needs to be run will do
- You will show the order of commands the user needs to run unless explicitly told to run them

## Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for new development
- Keep branches focused on a single feature or fix
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., Feature/add-user-auth, Fix/login-bug)
- Delete branches after merging

## Commits
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use conventional commit format when applicable
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Don't commit broken code

## Pull Requests
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Include a clear description of changes
- Request reviews before merging
- Ensure all tests pass before merging

## Best Practices
- Pull latest changes before starting new work
- Resolve conflicts promptly
- Don't force push to shared branches
- Keep main/master branch stable and deployable
