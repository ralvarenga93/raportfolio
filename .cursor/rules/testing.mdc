# Testing Rules

## Test Coverage
- Write tests for all new features
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests simple and focused

## Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Clean up test data after tests run

## Best Practices
- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD when appropriate)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Keep tests maintainable and readable
