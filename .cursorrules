# Cursor Project Rules

This project uses the official Cursor rules structure with rules stored in .cursor/rules/.

## Rules Location
All project-specific rules are automatically loaded from .cursor/rules/ directory. These rules are:
- **Automatically applied** - No need to reference them in prompts
- **Project-specific** - Only apply to this repository
- **Version controlled** - Stored in GitHub for team collaboration

## Current Rules
- General coding standards (general.mdc)
- Architecture guidelines (rchitecture.mdc)
- Testing standards (	esting.mdc)
- Documentation requirements (documentation.mdc)
- Git workflow rules (git-workflow.mdc)

## Quick Reference
- Always check existing code patterns before implementing new features
- Follow the project's established conventions
- Update documentation when adding new features
- Write tests for new functionality

For detailed rules, see the .mdc files in .cursor/rules/.
