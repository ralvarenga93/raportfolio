Portfolio for all my adventures.

## What this website is
This is my personal portfolio site that showcases my projects, skills, and work experience. It is V1 of the website, and more versions are planned as the portfolio evolves.

## Technologies and why they are used
- **Node.js**: Provides the JavaScript runtime for the development server, build tooling, and running the app in production.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better tooling, which reduces runtime errors and makes refactoring easier.
- **React**: Component-based UI makes the site modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
- **Next.js**: Enables a fast, production-ready React app with file-based routing, performance optimizations, and a strong developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling speeds up UI development and keeps styles consistent without a lot of custom CSS.
- **PostCSS + Autoprefixer**: Ensures CSS compatibility across modern browsers with minimal effort.
- **Framer Motion**: Adds smooth, performant animations to improve the visual experience.
- **ESLint**: Helps enforce code quality and consistency across the project.
